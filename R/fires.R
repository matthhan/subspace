#'The FIRES Algorithm for Subspace Clustering
#'
#'The FIRES Algorithm follows a three phase framework: In a first phase,
#'base-clusters are generated using a clustering-algorithm on each dimension in
#'isolation. Then these base-clusters are merged in a second phase to find
#'multidimensional cluster-approximations. These approximations are then refined
#'in the third phase.
#'
#'In this implementation, the first phase consists of a run of DBSCAN with the
#'parameters \emph{base_dbscan_epsilon} and \emph{base_dbscan_minpts} on the
#'objects as they appear from each particular dimension. Then, all of these
#'base-clusters whose size is smaller than \emph{minimumpercent} of the average
#'cluster size, e.g. 25% for the standard parameter setting, are discarded
#'because they are not likely to contain important information for the
#'clustering.
#'
#'In the second phase, these base clusters are merged to produce subspace
#'cluster approximations. This is achieved by computing the
#'\emph{k}-most-similar clusters for each base-cluster. Then the set of
#'best-merge-candidates for each base-cluster is determined, which contains
#'those clusters whose \emph{k}-most-similar clusters overlap the \emph{k}-most
#'similar clusters of the cluster by at least \emph{mu}. If a cluster has at
#'least \emph{minclu} best-merge-candidates,it is considered a best-merge
#'cluster. Finally, every pair of best-merge-clusters that are
#'best-merge-candidates of each other is grouped together with all of their
#'best-merge-candidates to form the cluster approximations.
#'
#'Note that some clusters need to be split and merged with two different other
#'clusters. This is done before the merging by determining whether the
#'intersection between a cluster and its most similar cluster as well as the
#'size of the cluster without this intersection are both larger than
#'\emph{split} times the average size of the base clusters.
#'
#'In the third phase, base-clusters are repeatedly removed from
#'cluster-approximations if their removal improves the amount of objects that
#'are shared by all base-clusters in the approximation. Finally, to generate the
#'definitive clusters from the cluster approximation, for each approximation all
#'base-clusters in the approximation are combined and the a clustering algorithm
#'is performed on these points. In this implementation, DBSCAN was chosen for
#'this purpose and will be performed with the parameters 
#'\emph{post_dbscan_epsilon} and \emph{post_dbscan_minpts}.
