#'The SubClu Algorithm for Subspace Clustering
#'
#'The SubClu Algorithm follows a bottom-up framework, in which one-dimensional
#'clusters are generated with DBSCAN and then each cluster is expanded one
#'dimension at a time into a dimension that is known to have a cluster that only
#'differs in one dimension from this cluster. This expansion is done using
#'DBSCAN with the same parameters that were used for the original DBSCAN that
#'produced the clusters.
#'
#'@param data A Matrix of input data.
#'@param epsilon size of environment parameter for DBSCAN
#'@param minSupport minimum number of points parameter for DBSCAN
